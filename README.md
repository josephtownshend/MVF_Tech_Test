# MVF_Tech_Test

### Wednesday evening

I spent the first evening getting to grips with GraphiQL, I had only used it very briefly so saw this as a good oppertunity to familiarise myself with it further. I managed to get it to query my GitHub account and search through a named repository and return the `primaryLanguage` of that repo.
